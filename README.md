# Node.js Sente reference example

> This example dives into Sente's full functionality pretty quickly; it's probably more useful as a reference than a tutorial. Please see Sente's top-level README for a gentler intro.

## Instructions

  1. Call `lein start` at your terminal, then point your browser at http://localhost:4000
  2. Observe std-out (server log) and web page textarea (client log)
